Add Services to this folder that are consistent with the DDD definition of "Service" (http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/125).

Hopefully over time, the rest of the older 'services' in the PeoplesSource.Domain.OldServicesProject namespace can be refactored to either comply with DDD semantics or they will be replaced over time through test driven refactoring.
